Report for Data Science project

River Don is an English river mainly in South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire, it derives from the Pennines and flows eastwardly through many major British cities, Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster for instance, and merges into the River Ouse eventually, and the total length of River Don is 70 miles (110km), around 1.3 million people are living along the rive.

*Caption: Figures 1 and 2 are the integrated hydrographs of River Don in Sheffield 2007 and 2019 flood events respectively. Figures 3 and 4 are integrated hydrographs of River Don in Rotherham 2007 and 2019 flood events respectively.*

*Caption: Figure 1 and 2 are hypothetical schemes for Rotherham in both 2007 and 2019 River Don flood events, Figure 3 reveals the flood mitigation schemes provided by Sheffield City Council; all of these three schemes could alleviate 100% of flood water.*


# River Calder

## Data selection

With the earliest record dating back to 1615, Calderdale has a long history of flooding. It has suffered from floods for many reasons like sedimentation of drainage assets, surface water flooding, and severe inundation in rainy seasons as many canals and rivers are closely linked in these areas. What is worse, due to global warming, extreme events may happen more often under unstable climates. Out of interest and concern about this area, the author chooses River Calder and Hebden Water as subjects, selecting two flooding events in 2015 and 2020 at three monitoring stations to analyse the flooding and make mitigation plans.

*Caption: Figure 8: Hydrograph of River Calder at Mytholmroyd station in December 2015 with the error rate 0.14. The error rate is supposed by author which can be replaced by other rates. The lower bound and the upper bound are related to the choice of error rate.*
